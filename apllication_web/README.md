# DEVOPS WEB API APPLICATION 

### This project is a basic DevOps web application created with Node.js, Express, Redis, and unit and API testing. 
## Data are stocked in Redis.
## It follows the following steps:

### 1. Create a GitHub Repository: Create a GitHub repository to host your project.

### 2. Clone the Repository: Clone the GitHub repository to your local machine.

### 3. Initialize the Project: Initialize the Node.js project using the npm init command.

>>npm init
##4. Configure Express and Redis: Install the Express and Redis dependencies for our application.

>>npm install express redis
### 5. Create Project Structure: Organize the project by creating the following folders:

   ## public: Folder for static files such JavaScript, etc.
    
   ## src: Folder for your application's source code.
    
  ## controllers: Folder for your application's controllers.
    
    models: Folder for data models.
    
    routes: Folder for API routes.
    
    test: Folder for unit and API tests.
    
### 6. Configure the Express Application: In the app.js file, configure your Express application,
   including route handling, connecting to Redis, etc.

### 7. Create an API Endpoint: Create a REST API endpoint to retrieve user information from the database.

### 8. Write Tests: Create unit tests and API tests for your application. Use libraries such as Mocha, Chai, and Supertest for testing.

### 9. Run Tests: Execute the tests to ensure your application works correctly.

>> npm start
## My DevOps API application is now up and running!
